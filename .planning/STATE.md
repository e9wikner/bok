# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** The system should let a small Swedish company keep compliant books with minimal manual interaction by giving an agent enough source material, history, and correction feedback to post accurate vouchers.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — bank-input-and-direct-posting-context

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New project initialized as brownfield: existing bookkeeping, agent, attachment, and bank-import capabilities are validated scope.
- Intake workflow is automation-first: agent posts vouchers directly from source material.
- User review happens after posting through existing B-series correction flows.
- Bank statements/statuses are source input for creating missing vouchers, not only reconciliation.
- Initial roadmap uses MVP mode for all phases.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Confirm during Phase 1 planning whether the connected agent can download/read original PDFs and images directly.
- Bank statement format examples are needed during Phase 2 planning/testing.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |

| Extraction | OCR/text extraction for uploaded PDFs/images | v2 candidate | Initialization |
| Bank automation | Open Banking connection and periodic sync | v2 candidate | Initialization |
